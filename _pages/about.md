Hello! I am Deepak Nathani. I am currently a 1st year PhD student at [UC, Santa Barbara](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/) advised by [Prof. William Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/) in the [UCSB NLP](http://nlp.cs.ucsb.edu/) lab. My research interests lie broadly in the areas of Natural Language Generation, Commonsense Reasoning, and Dialog Systems. Recently, I have been interested in methods to localize knowledge within LLMs and how to effectively use external non-parametric knowledge to solve commonsense reasoning problems.

In the past, I have worked as a **Pre-Doctoral Researcher** at [Google Research, India](https://research.google/locations/india/) with [Dr. Partha Talukdar](https://research.google/people/ParthaTalukdar/). At Google, I worked on Controllable Text Generation and Conversational AI. I have also worked as a **Software Engineering AMTS** at [Salesforce.com](https://www.salesforce.com/). 

I graduated from [IIT Hyderabad](https://iith.ac.in/) with a B.Tech degree in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science as my second major. During my time as an undergraduate, I worked on various research problems with [Dr. Manohar Kaul](https://manukaul.github.io/).

Among other things, I enjoy playing games, listening to music, reading books and most important of them all, I love food. :wink:
